To study these phenomena I need the organisational status &mdash; foundation/dissolution date, organisational status &mdash; of individual charities. The Australian charity regulator provides high quality, open data on the organisational status of charities, with the exception of dissolution status. Therefore I wrote a script that takes a list of charity ids and scrapes information on organisational status from the regulator's website.\n",
